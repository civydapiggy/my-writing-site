countless times i lie

ripped              apart
with no mercy

past your posts of her 
of your favorite person of 
your other ha lf of your best 
friend you would not survive 
without 
the one you can always rely   
on who can accept you for 
who you are the one you 
can speak your thoughts 
to and never having worries
    sail    through your mind of
being judged the one you 
can call to celebrate wins 
and yet com-fort you in dark 
times the one you can gossip 
to about boys and how they’ll 
never r-
each the standard
of aaron warner or zade 
meadows the one you can 
drink icy matcha with binge 
watch too many gilmore girls 
for the good of the world who 
can paint your 
                         naked 
                chipped 
nails and patiently map out the 
beauty and scars of your face
on canvas the one who’ll always 
listen and remember you are 
human too that you feel pain 
and the one that knows there 
is hell bu bb ling within you 
while all is hidden under that 
soft gentle smile and those 
angelic eyes the one you can
say “i’m not o k” to and they
will bring you your favorite 
toblerones and put on all the 
lewis capaldi songs in existence
on repeat. on repeat.
i wish to have a someone like
yours.
