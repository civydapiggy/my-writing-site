# my-writing-site

You may wonder why this site is of existence.
Code and writing. One builds with logic, the other with language, but both create worlds beyond what the mind can hold. 
So I thought, why not create a place where code gives writing a home?
Here you will find my personal writing archive where I publish all my poems and short pieces.
If you do happen to read any, I thank you dearly.
