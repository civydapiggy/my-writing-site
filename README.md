# my-writing-site

You may wonder why this site is of existence.
I love to code and write, so I thought, why not build a place where both can live together?
Here you will find my personal writing archive where I publish all my poems and short pieces.
If you do happen to read any, I thank you dearly.
I hope you have a great day :)
